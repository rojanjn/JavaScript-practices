# JavaScript Practice Playground

Welcome to my JavaScript sandbox! This repository is a growing collection of JS practice problems, code snippets, small projects, and wild experiments as I work my way through mastering JavaScript—one bug at a time. 🐛💥

## What's Inside

- Core JavaScript concepts (variables, functions, loops, etc.)
- Array & object methods
- Coding challenges and problem-solving drills
- DOM manipulation fun
- Asynchronous JavaScript (promises, fetch, async/await)
- Random experiments and creative chaos

## Purpose

This repo is part learning lab, part digital brain-dump. It's where I mess around, learn by doing, and occasionally write something that actually works :)

Feel free to explore, fork, suggest improvements, or laugh at my early code. If you're learning too, I hope this helps you along the way!
